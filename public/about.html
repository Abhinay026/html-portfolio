<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently working as a senior BI engineer handling the UI as well.I collaborate with the Data Engineering, UI, and Data Science teams.As far DataEngineering team is concerned I am involved in architecting the pipelines based on business requirements in the AWS and GCP cloud. 
We deal with near real-time data used for analytical purposes. I also collaborate with the data science teams in creating efficient models. In the recent project with USAA, we worked on developing clustering algorithms for the customer segmentation project. Apart from these, I am also associated with building deep-learning neural nets and GAI models using pytorch and tensorflow. 
In gathering the data I have worked with Databricks, ADF, and AWS services like Kinesis, and EMR clusters.For creating Big Data efficient ETL pipelines I have used spark and hadoop. 
I used to develop Pyspark scripts to run the data transformation jobs in data bricks and EMR clusters.
With respect to data modeling and databases. I worked on creating optimized data models - conceptual, logical, and schema design. 
In dealing with structured and unstructured data, Experienced with both Relational and NoSQL databases for data retrieval. Also experienced with writing optimized queries-indexing, shuffling, partitioning, bucketing, etc. 
Creating data lakes and data warehouses is also part of this modeling.Visualization tools: Tableau, PowerBI, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Analytics, AWS Quicksight</p>

<p>UI/UX Experience<br/>
<hr/>
I worked on creating front-end web applications in javascript using react, angular framework-client side single page web applications. 
Creating the UI for displaying the tableau dashboards. Not only UI I also developed full-stack web applications using Angular 12, Express JS, MongoDB, and NodeJS. (Mean Stack)
Used NodeJS for creating server-side applications- build web servers and Restful APIs
I also used to create APIs in Python using Flask framework and deployment using Postman
React JS version 17, 18 - React library for front-end development -  We develop Single page applications( That load only once) - advantages less traffic to the server and less internet usage to the user.</p>
